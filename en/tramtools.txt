<h1><strong>Tram/light rail tools</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Tram/light rail tools</strong> construct a tram transport network. The tools may build: tramtrack (and electrify or remove it), signals, a tram depot, and tram stops.
If playing with <a href="new_world.txt">timeline</a>, then as time passes in Simutrans more tool options may appear.
</p>
<p>
Click tram-icon at top of the main game window to open toolbar.<br>
Hover the mouse cursor over a toolbar icon (after opening or clicking on toolbar) to see name and where appropriate: construction <a href="finances.txt">cost</a>, and maximum speed limit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tram/light rail tools</strong> include, from left to right:
</p>
<p>
<em>Tram Track:</em> tools build Track, for rail vehicles between two points.<br>
Tram Track can be built along roads and in urban areas, but not on areas occupied by other buildings. Tracks can only be built on slopes in the direction of the slope and not over rough terrain, water and obstructions. New Track built may use existing track in its path.<br>
To build Track: click on the tool icon to select Track (changes cursor to track); then click on the main game window for start-point of Track (shows a bulldozer in the main game window and displays map co-ordinates on right of bottom-bar under the main game window); and finally click on the main game window for end-point for Track.<br>
<em>Tip:</em>  Different types of tracks may connect (however not when built by some other <a href="players.txt">players</a>). Use <a href="railtools.txt">bridges</a> and tunnels to connect tracks across rough terrain or to avoid obstructions. Use the destroy/remove tool to remove individual pieces of Track and some obstructions. Use <a href="keys.txt">[Ctrl]</a> at same time for extra functions. Undo [z] does not refund constructions costs.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Electrify Track:</em> tools electrify Track, bridges or tunnels between two points in the main game window, for use by electric vehicles.<br>
To electrify Track: click on the tool icon or press [e] (changes cursor to electric-track-icon) to select, then click on Track in the main game window for start-point of electrification (places a electric-track-icon in the main game window), and finally click on a second point on Track, to electrify portion of Track up to start-point.<br>
<em>Tip:</em> Use the destroy/remove tool to change back to non-electric Tracks.
</p>
<p>
<em>Remove Tracks:</em> tool removes Track and electric Track, when no vehicles are present, between two points in the main game window (station-platforms, road-stops, signals, tunnels and bridges in path are removed too). Use of tool incurs a <a href="finances.txt">construction cost</a>.<br>
To remove Track: click on the tool icon (changes cursor to a red-cross); then click on track that is to be deleted (selects deletion-point shown by a red cross in the main game window); and finally click at a second-point on connected Track, to remove portion up to first deletion-point.<br>
<em>Tip:</em> Operate as another player to remove their Tracks.
</p>
<p>
<em>Rail Signals:</em> tools build signals for rail vehicles on a Track in the main game window. Signals direct and regulate flow of vehicles on tracks and bridges, junctions and <a href="station.txt">Stops</a> (where vehicles pick up and drop off goods and passengers).<br>
Two-way and one-way versions of signals can be built. To build a two-way signal on track: click on the tool icon to select signal (changes cursor to signals); then click on track. To build a one-way signal: click again at same point, with signals-cursor, to cycle through one-way signals, back to a two-way signal.<br>
IMPORTANT: Take care not to place one-way signals that prevent vehicles reaching their destination, by default vehicles drive on the right (can be changed in simuconf.tab).<br>
- <em>Signals:</em> vehicles proceed only if Track ahead up to next signal or destination in <a href="schedule.txt">Schedule</a> (a <a href="station.txt">Stop</a> or waypoint) is not occupied by another vehicle. In one-way mode vehicles pass in one direction only.<br>
- <em>RailClose:</em> vehicles do not proceed beyond signal (available in one-way mode only).<br>
- <em>PreSignals:</em> vehicles proceed if area of Track ahead (either between three consecutive signals or to next destination in <a href="schedule.txt">Schedule</a>) is not occupied by another vehicle. In one-way mode they let vehicles pass in one direction only.<br>
- <em>ChooseSignals:</em> direct vehicles to an empty station-platform, at a multi-platform <a href="station.txt">Stop</a>: a vehicle passing this signal may use any empty platform at its next destination, and not just the one assigned in its <a href="schedule.txt">schedule</a>. If no empty platform or clear route to next destination is found, then vehicles wait at signal.<br>
<em>Tip:</em>  Remove signals with the destroy/remove tool. Hold down [Ctrl] to place signals on bridges over lower Tracks.
</p>
<p>
<em>Tram</em> <a href="depot.txt"><em>Depot:</em></a> tool builds a depot for purchasing and managing trams.<br>
Depots have a maintenance cost and are built on the end of track in the main game window.<br>
To build a tram depot: click on the tool icon (changes cursor to a depot), then click on end of Track.<br>
<em>Tip:</em> Depots only show electric vehicles if they are on electric Track. Remove depots with the destroy/remove tool.
</p>
<p>
<em>?Rail-stops:</em> tools build station-platforms, used by rail vehicles to pick up and drop off goods, passengers and mail.<br>
A station-platform when not built adjacent to an existing <a href="station.txt">Stop</a> will create a new Stop.<br>
Rail-stops have a maintenance cost and are built on Track (but not at bends and junctions in Track).<br>
Rail-stops have a catchment area for goods, passengers and mail. Different station-platforms may have different capacities for passengers and mail. In the corner of some tool options an icon (used in <a href="haltlist.txt">Station List</a> and Stop Information) shows which items the station-platform allows a Stop to handle.<br>
To build a a station-platform: click on the tool icon to select (changes cursor to a platform), then click on Track.<br>
<em>Tip:</em> Remove Rail-stops with the destroy/remove tool. Extend station-platforms and build multi-platform Stops (by building more platform sections on adjacent Track) to accommodate longer and more vehicles, increase capacity and catchment area. Press <a href="keys.txt">[v]</a> to show/hide catchment area for goods and passengers in the main game window. Hold down [Ctrl] to build on bridges above lower Tracks.
</p>
<p>
<em>Car Parking:</em> (available only in pak 128) tools construct extensions for <a href="station.txt">Stops</a> which increase capacity and catchment area for goods and passengers, and maintenance cost.<br>
To build an extension: click on the tool icon to select extension (changes cursor to extension), then click required position on a road, beside an existing Stop in the main game window. The new extension is now considered to be part of the Stop.<br>
<em>Tip:</em> Remove extensions with the the destroy/remove tool.
</p>
<p>
<em>?Road-stops:</em> tools build places for trams and road vehicles to pick up and drop off goods, mail, and passengers.<br>
A Road-stop when not built adjacent to an existing <a href="station.txt">Stop</a> will create a new Stop.
Road-stops are built on<a href="roadtools.txt">road</a>and have a maintenance cost and a catchment area for goods, passengers and mail. In the corner of some tool options an icon (used in Station List and Stop Information) shows which items the Road-stop allows a Stop to handle. Different Road-stops may have different capacities for goods, passengers and mail.<br>
To build a Road-stop: click on the tool icon to select (changes cursor to roadstop), then click required position on a road in the main game window.<br>
<em>Tip:</em> Remove Road-stops with the the destroy/remove tool. Hold down [Ctrl] to build on bridges above lower roads.
