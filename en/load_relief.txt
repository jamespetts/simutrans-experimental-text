<h1><strong>Load Height Map</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Load Height Map</strong> is used to open a file of a custom-made terrain (to use for a new game) and can be used to delete these files.<br>
<p>
<strong>Load Height Map</strong> opens from <a href="new_world.txt">Create a New Game</a>; and list names, date and time (of save) of available custom-terrains.<br>
If all files are not visible: use <a href="mouse.txt">the slider bar</a> on right-side of list, to scroll names.
</p>
<p>
Click on name in list to use a custom-terrain; or enter name into box at top of window: click on box, type name, and press <a href="keys.txt">[Enter]</a> or [Return] or click on<em>OK</em>(an incorrect name will have no effect, try again).
</p>
<p>
WARNING: Click x-button by left of name to DELETE file immediately and permanently, the filename is removed from list and <strong>Load Height Map</strong> closes. Use this function carefully.
</p>
<p>
Some custom-made terrains are available online at http://addons.simutrans.com.<br>
The new file must be in .ppm format and placed in the directory (or folder) named...simutrans/save/
