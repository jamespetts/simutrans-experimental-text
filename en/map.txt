<h1><strong>Map</strong></h1>

<p>
The <strong>Map</strong> provides a map of the current game world, giving information on terrain, important locations and transport networks. It also provides a way to move the main game window around the world.
</p>
<p>
Click on the map icon at top of the main game window or press <a href="keys.txt">[m]</a> to open the <strong>Map</strong>, which can be <a href="mouse.txt">re-sized</a> or minimised. The left/right-arrows on the titlebar, close/open in stages: map options, a coloured scale for some of the options, and a key to the colours of <a href="industry_info.txt">industries</a> seen on the map.
</p>
<p>
The map can be zoomed in and out using the "zoom" control: the scale goes from 4:1 to 1:4. If the whole map is not visible then change the map scale, re-size the <strong>Map</strong> window, or move the map to see required portion. To move around the map, you can click and drag it (using the right mouse button), or use the slider bars.
<p>
</p>
On the map, water is blue and lower land is darker than higher land. Shallower water is lighter than deeper water. The part of the game world currently in focus in the main game window is shown by a white square outline in on the map: top of the main game window corresponds to top left side of the white square (North is at the top of the map: North-West is at top of the main game window). If the white square falls off the map, water is seen in the main game window for the corresponding area.
</p>
<p>
To move the main game window to another place on the map, left click on the point on the map that you would like to be the centre of the main game window. Dragging also works.
</p>
<p>
If the <em>factory details</em> checkbox is checked, hovering the mouse cursor over an <a href="industry_info.txt">industry</a> on the map shows its name, and a white line connecting it to its consumers (if any), which flash. Holding down <a href="keys.txt">[Shift]</a> whilst hovering over an industry will instead show connexions to that industry's suppliers (if any) in red. Those also flash.
</p>
<p>
On the map (when not using certain legend options): <a href="citywindow.txt">urban areas</a>, attractions and tunnels, appear light grey; rivers and canals appear blue; bridges appear off-white, roads appear dark grey; railways, and tramways appear dark red; monorail tracks appear orange; narrow gauge and maglev railways appear black; runways and taxiways appear dark yellow; <a href="station.txt">stops</a> appear light red; and vehicles appear light yellow.
</p>
<p>
Check the <em>show schedules</em> checkbox to enable a graphical display of a convoy or line's schedule on the map when a schedule is being edited: a light terquoise thin line will link all the points in the currently selected schedule by a straight line.
</p>
<p>
Check the <em>isometric view</em> checkbox to show the map in the same isometric orientation as the main game window.
</p>

Destinations are shown by coloured dots. The colour of destination dots shows information about passengers and mail:<br>
- <em>Dark yellow</em>: passengers were able to walk the whole way to their destination.<br>

- <em>Terquoise</em>: passengers reached the destination by means of their private cars.<br>
- <em>Orange</em>: there is no available route to the desired destination.<br>
- <em>Purple</em>: there is a route to the desired destination, but it takes too long for passengers to tolerate.<br>
