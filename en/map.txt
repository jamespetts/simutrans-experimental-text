<h1><strong>Map</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Map</strong> provides a map of the current world giving information on terrain, important locations, and transport networks. It also provides a way to move the main game window around world.
</p>
<p>
Click on map-icon at top of the main game window or press <a href="keys.txt">[m]</a> to open <strong>Map</strong>, which can be <a href="mouse.txt">re-sized</a> or minimised. The left/right-arrows, on the titlebar, close/open in stages: map options, a min-max colour scale that shows activity level for some of the options, and a key to colours of <a href="industry_info.txt">industry</a> seen on the map.
</p>
<p>
The map has three different scales: right-click on Map (or point cursor and use mouse-wheel) to cycle through scales. If whole map is not visible then change the map scale, or re-size <strong>Map</strong>, or move map to see required portion: right-click-drag map (or use slider bars at sides).
<p>
</p>
On the map, water is blue and lower land is darker than higher land. Part of world in the main game window, is shown by a white-square outline in <strong>Map</strong>: top of the main game window corresponds to top-left-side of white-square (North is at top of map, North-West is at top of the main game window). If the white-square falls off the map, water is seen in the main game window for corresponding area.
</p>
<p>
To move the main game window across large distances in world, left-click on map at required point or left-click-drag white-square.
</p>
<p>
Point the mouse cursor at an <a href="industry_info.txt">industry</a> on map, to see name and a white line linking customer(s) which flash; hold down [Shift] first to show a red line to supplier(s).
</p>
<p>
