<title>Depot Controls Help</title>

<h1><strong>Depot Controls</strong></h1>

<p>
Depots are used to purchase and manage vehicles and convoys. Different types of transport have their own depot. Electric vehicles may only be purchased from a depot that is on an electrified way, which is indicated by a red lightning flash in the top right hand corner. If playing with the <a href="new_world.txt">timeline</a> turned on, then, as time passes, in Simutrans more vehicles may become available.
</p>
<p>
Tools for the construction of different depots are available from the construction toolbar for the respective type of transport: <a href="railtools.txt">railway depots</a>; <a href="narrowgaugetools.txt">narrow gauge railway depots</a>, <a href="monorailtools.txt">monorail depots</a>; <a href="maglevtools.txt">maglev depots</a>;  <a href="tramtools.txt">tram depots</a>; <a href="roadtools.txt">road garages</a>; <a href="shiptools.txt">shipyards</a>; and <a href="airtools.txt">aircraft hangars</a>.
</p>
<p>
Click on a depot in the main game window with the <a href="inspection_tool.txt">inspection tool</a> to open the <strong>depot controls</strong> window. The <strong>depot controls</strong> window provides information about and allows the purchase, sale, upgrading and management of <a href="convoiinfo.txt">convoys</a>. The title bar of the <strong>depot controls</strong> window indicates which type of vehicle transport that the depot serves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Depot Controls</strong> can be <a href="mouse.txt">re-sized</a> (click on down-arrow on titlebar of controls to return to original size).<br>
Click on left/right-arrows on titlebar to cycle through depots of the same transport type (centres the main game window on depot).
</p>
<p>

<em>The vehicles:</em> are split into categories, which can be viewed by clicking on the appropriate tabs. The tabs divide the vehicles into the following groups: vehicles for passengers and mail, other powered (motorised) vehicles, and unpowered trailers/carriages. If the depot is electrified (shown by a red lightning flash in the top-right hand corner), there will also be a separate tab for powered electric units (called "trolleybuses" if the depot is a road depot).

There are two drop-down menus underneath the word <strong>Vehicles:</strong>. To cycle through either of them, either press the left or right arrows, or click the text to see all the options at once.
</p>
<p>
The first vehicle operations menu has three options:<br>

<em>Put in front:</em> purchases a vehicle and adds it to front of selected convoy, or, if no convoy is selected, creates a new convoy, and adds it to that.<br>
<em>Sell Now:</em> sells a stored vehicle of the type selected.<br>
</p>
<p>
The second vehicle operations menu has two options:<br>
<em>Buy/sell</em>: This is the default mode. Vehicles are either purchased or sold outright.<br>
<em>Upgrade</em>: In this mode, existing vehicles are upgraded to other vehicles. When this is selected, the cost shown will be the cost of upgrading any existing vehicles to the selected vehicle, not the cost of buying it new. Unless <strong>show all</strong> is selected, only vehicles to which the current vehicle can be upgraded will be shown.</br>
<p>
<em>Color bars</em>: under the each vehicle graphic, there are coloured bars, which indicate whether the vehicles can be purchased, upgraded, or used in particular combinations in a <a href="convoiinfo.txt">convoy</a>. Colour bars may change with different settings in the vehicles operations menus.<br>

- <em>Purple:</em> the current vehicle cannot be upgraded to this vehicle.<br>

A convoy that can be used shows green bars for all the vehicles in it. If any yellow bars are visible, then another vehicle is required next to the one with the yellow bar to make the convoy useable.
</p>
<p>
<em>Show all:</em> by default, only vehicles that can be used and purchased/upgraded are shown. Selecting this option displays all vehicles, whether they can be used or not.
<p>
