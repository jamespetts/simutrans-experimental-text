<h1><strong>Convoy Details</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Convoy details</strong> provides more information about a <a href="convoiinfo.txt">convoy</a> and can be used to sell the convoy immediately, or withdraw it.
</p>
<p>

<strong>Convoy Details</strong> can be accessed from the <a href="convoiinfo.txt">Details</a> button in the <strong>convoy information</strong> window.
<br>
If not all items are visible, <a href="mouse.txt">re-size</a> the <strong>convoy wetails</strong> window or use the slider bars to scroll.
</p>
<p>
At the top of the <strong>convoy details</strong> window, information shown includes:
</p>
<p>
<em>Power:</em> of the convoy (combined power of all motorised vehicles in the convoy).
</p>
<p>
<em>Resale value:</em> the amount of money that would be realised if convoy was sold now (the older each vehicle in a convoy, the less that it is worth).
</p>
<p>
<h1>Buttons:</h1><br>
- <em>Withdraw</em>: The convoy will continue in service until all of the goods or passengers on board have reached their destination.  No new goods or passengers will be loaded. Once the vehicle is empty, it will be sold without returning to a depot. If the vehicle is already empty, it will be sold immediately.<br>
- <em>Sell now</em>: The convoy will be sold straight away, without returning to a depot. All of the goods or passengers on board will be lost.<br>
- <em>Retire</em>: The convoy will continue in service until all of the goods or passengers on board have reached their destination. No new goods or passengers will be loaded. Once the vehicle is empty, it will go to the nearest depot, but will be stored, not sold.
