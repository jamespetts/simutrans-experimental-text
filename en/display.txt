<h1><strong>Display Settings</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Display Settings</strong>lets you control how the game appears, and provides information on computer performance.
</p>
<p>
Click on the display button in the <a href="options.txt">Game Options</a> menu to open the <strong>Display Settings</strong> window.
</p>
<p>
Click on the square buttons to select options (the button is indented when the option is selected), or use the <a href="mouse.txt">arrow buttons</a> to adjust settings:
</p>
<p>
- <em>Show grid:</em> shows the lines between the individual tiles. This can be useful when terraforming.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Underground view:</em> reveals beneath the ground to show tunnels and underground transport networks.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Day and night change:</em> if this is enabled, the game window will slowly cycle through dawn, day, dusk and night, giving graphical variety. If unselected, the game will be permantently set to a particular time of day, depending on the <strong>brightness</strong> setting.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Brightness:</em> affects the ambient light used in the main game window. The higher the number, the darker.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Brightness:</em>sets how light/dark view of game appears; lower number to darken; too low or high values produce problems; use <a href="keys.txt">[+]</a> to increase value over 0.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Scroll Inverse:</em> reverses direction of scroll in the main game window in <a href="window.txt">Game Window</a>.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Scroll Speed:</em> sets speed of scrolling in the main game window.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Transparent instead of hidden:</em> objects that are selected as hidden will instead appear see-through.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Hide trees:</em> all trees will either be made very small, or made transparent, depending on how the last option is set. 
</p>
<p>
- <em>Building settings:</em> determines which, if any, buildings are hidden from view. If <strong>no buildings hidden</strong> is selected, then all buildings are visible. If <strong>hide city buildings</strong> is selected, then only player-built buildings, town halls, industries and tourist attractions will be visible. If <strong>hide all buildings</strong> is selected, then all buildings apart from station/stop buildings will be hidden, but town halls will be highlighted in green, monuments will be highlighted in pink, tourist attractions in yellow, and industries in red.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Transparent station coverage:</em> shows the catchment area of stops/stations as transparent, rather than as a grid.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Show station coverage:</em> displays the catchment area for each station in the main game window. Use the <a href="keys.txt">[V]</a> key to toggle this display.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Show station names:</em> toggle whether the name of each station is displayed in the main game window.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Show waiting bars:</em> toggle whether the miniature bar graphs showing the proportion of waiting goods/passengers as against the station's total capacity is displayed in the main map window.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Pedestrians in towns:</em> toggles whether pedestrians that appear in <a href="citywindow.txt">urban areas</a> are displayed.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Pedestrians at stops:</em> toggles whether pedestrians that appear when a vehicle arrives at a <a href="station.txt">stop</a> are displayed.
</p>
<p>
- <em>Traffic density:</em> sets volume of private car traffic displayed in the main game window in <a href="citywindow.txt">urban areas</a>. Note that this setting only alters the number of cars actually visible in the main game window: it does not alter the number of <a href="privatecar.txt">private car</a> trips generated, nor the level of congestion in urban areas, or any other aspect of the simulation itself. 
</p>
<p>
- <em>Convoy tool tips:</em> customises the amount of information displayed about convoys in the main game window.
</p>
<p>
<em>Tip</em>: More options and default values for when Simutrans starts can be changed in the simuconf.tab file, located in /simutrans/config/.
</p>

<strong>Display Information:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Below these settings, information is shown on computer performance when running Simutrans.<br>
If numbers (usually white) are red or ?yellow you may need to change your settings.<br>
Changes in rate that time passes in game, <a href="window.txt">T</a>, (using Fast Forward  >> icon at top of the main game window, or [,]/ [.]) may change number colour.
</p>
<p>
<em>Frame Time:</em> The first number is intended time between frames; second number is actual time between frames.
</p>
<p>
<em>Idle:</em> When above 0, the computer has capacity to run other software without adversely impacting the performance of Simutrans.
</p>
<p>
<em>
FPS:</em> Higher values mean vehicles appear to move more smoothly. If number remains red, the computer is too slow for current settings (try reducing the size of the main game window).
</p>
<p>
<em>Simloops:</em> If this number remains red, the computer is too slow for current settings - try a smaller map with fewer urban areas.
