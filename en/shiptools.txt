<h1><strong>Dock/harbour tools</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Dock/harbour tools</strong> construct a marine and waterway transport network. Tools may build or remove: canals, locks, various docks, and a ship depot. If playing with <a href="new_world.txt">timeline</a>, then as time passes in Simutrans more tool options may appear.

<p>
Click boat-icon at top of the main game window to open toolbar.<br>
Hover the mouse cursor over a toolbar icon (after opening or clicking on toolbar) to see name and where appropriate: construction <a href="finances.txt">cost</a>, maintenance cost in brackets, and maximum speed and weight limits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dock/harbour tools</strong> include, from left to right:
</p>
<p>
<em>Canal:</em> tool builds waterways, for boats and barges, between two points in the main game window.<br>
Canals can only be built on slopes in the direction of the slope and may not find a path across rough terrain. Canals built between points, may use existing canal in its path.<br>
To build a canal: click on the tool icon to select (changes cursor to canal), then click on terrain for start-point (shows a bulldozer in the main game window and map co-ordinates on right of bottom-bar under the main game window), and finally click on terrain for end-point.<br>
<em>Tip:</em> Canals built by different <a href="players.txt">players</a> may not connect. Use <a href="slopetools.txt">Landscape tools</a> to change terrain, to enable paths for canals. Use the destroy/remove tool to remove individual pieces of canal and some obstructions. Undo last route connection <a href="keys.txt">[z]</a> does not refund constructions costs.
</p>
<p>
<em>Remove channels:</em> tool removes portion of canal, when no vehicles are present, between two points in the main game window (NB: Channel-stops in path are removed too). The tool has an associated construction cost.<br>
To remove canal: click on the tool icon (changes cursor to a cross); then click on canal that is to be deleted (selects deletion-point shown by a red cross in the main game window); and finally click at another point on canal, to remove portion up to first deletion-point.
</p>

<em>Ship Hoist:</em> tool builds a canal lock and bridge to raise/lower a boat or barge by one level on a canal in the main game window. The bridge has a maximum span and is built on the end of a canal to a suitable place (another canal-end or slightly higher land, within span).<br>
To build bridge: click on the tool icon to select bridge (changes cursor to hoist), then click on the end of a canal, (starting-point of bridge). Some obstructions or lack of a suitable place for bridge-ends may stop hoist being built: build canal at both sides that is to be bridged, and try again.<br>
<em>Tip:</em> Use the destroy/remove tool to remove bridges (click on hoist-end) and some obstructions to bridge building.<br>
Use <em>Canal</em> tools to connect bridge-ends to water ways..

<em>Wharf</em> (<em>Canal Quay</em> in pak128) tool builds a dock on a canal in the main game window for water-transport-vehicles to pick up and drop off cargo and passengers.<br>
A dock when not built adjacent to an existing <a href="station.txt">Stop</a> will create a new Stop.<br>
A dock has a catchment area for goods, passengers and mail. In the corner of the a toolbar icon is an icon (used in <a href="haltlist.txt">Station List</a> and <a href="station.txt">Stop Information</a>) shows which items the dock allows a Stop to handle.<br>
To build a dock: click on the tool icon (changes cursor to a channelstop); then click on a canal in the main game window to construct.<br>
<em>Tip:</em> Remove docks with the destroy/remove tool. Press <a href="keys.txt">[v]</a> to show/hide catchment area for goods and passengers in the main game window.<br>
Stops just for water transport vehicles will not be listed in <a href="haltlist.txt">?Stops/Station list</a>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Ship-stops:</em> tools build various items that construct docks in the main game window for water-transport-vehicles to pick up and drop off cargo and passengers.<br>
Docks are built at edges of straight coast.<br>
A dock when not built adjacent to an existing <a href="station.txt">Stop</a> will create a new Stop.<br>
Docks have a catchment area for goods, passengers and mail. In the corner of the a toolbar icon is an icon (used in Station List and Stop Information) that shows which items the dock allows a Stop to handle. Different docks may have different capacities for goods, passengers and mail. <br>
To build a dock: click on the tool icon to select (changes cursor to a dock) and then click on a slope by water to build<br>
<em>Tip:</em> Remove docks with the destroy/remove tool.<br>
Size of docks can be increased by building on adjacent squares. Water-transport vehicles may use any square of water in the catchment area of a dock.<br>
Stops just for water transport vehicles will not be listed in <a href="haltlist.txt">?Stops/Station list</a>.<br>
Off-shore <a href="industry_info.txt">Industry</a> such as Oil Rigs do not require a dock, water-transport vehicles may use any square of water in the catchment area of an off-shore Industry.<br>
Press <a href="keys.txt">[v]</a> to show/hide catchment area for goods and passengers in the main game window.

<p>
<em>Ship <a href="depot.txt"><em>Depot:</em></a></em> tool builds a depot for purchasing and managing ships, boats and barges. Depots have a maintenance cost and are built on water in the main game window.<br>
To build a ship depot: click on the tool icon (changes cursor to a depot), then click on water in the main game window.<br>
<em>Tip:</em> Remove depots with the destroy/remove tool.
